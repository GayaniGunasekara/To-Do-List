# 🚀 From Curiosity to Code | Self-Taught JavaScript & GitHub Journey

Started with a blank screen — ended up building a **fully functional To-Do List Web App** 💻  
Just me, **JavaScript**, some **CSS**, **HTML**, and the **will to learn** 💡

✨ **What I built — and learned:**  
- 📝 Create, edit, and delete tasks  
- 🎯 Drag-and-drop task reordering (**pure JS!**)  
- ⏰ Due date + real-time reminder notifications  
- 🌙 Dark mode with persistent settings  
- 💾 Data stored locally via `localStorage`  
- 📦 Git + GitHub for version control  

This project was **100% self-taught** — and it taught me **much more than just syntax**.  
It gave me confidence, problem-solving practice, and **real hands-on skills**.
